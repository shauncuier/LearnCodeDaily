🎤 Video Script for All 10 Problems
Intro

👋 “Hi everyone, my name is [Your Name]. In this video, I’ll solve some JavaScript problem-solving tasks using only plain JavaScript. I’ll explain my logic step by step and show the outputs in the console. Let’s get started.”

## Problem 1: Reverse a String

    🗣 “The first problem is reversing a string. For example, if the input is ‘hello’, the output should be ‘olleh’.
    My logic: I split the string into characters, reverse the array, and then join it back. Let’s run it with input ‘hello’ … and we get ‘olleh’. Perfect.”

## Problem 2: Count Vowels in a String

    🗣 “The second problem is counting vowels. For example, in the word ‘programming’, there are 3 vowels.
    My logic: I define a set of vowels, loop through each character of the string, and increase a counter whenever the character is a vowel. Testing with ‘programming’, the result is 3.”

## Problem 3: Check for Palindrome

    🗣 “The third problem is checking if a string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forward and backward, like ‘madam’.
    My logic: I reverse the string and compare it with the original. If they’re equal, it’s a palindrome. For ‘madam’, we get true. For ‘hello’, we get false.”

## Problem 4: Find the Maximum Number

    🗣 “The next problem is finding the largest number in an array.
    My logic: I assume the first element is the maximum, then loop through the array. If I find a bigger number, I update the maximum. For input [5, 1, 9, 3], the result is 9.”

## Problem 5: Remove Duplicates from an Array

    🗣 “Now, let’s remove duplicates from an array. For example, [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4] should become [1, 2, 3, 4].
    My logic: I loop through the array and keep a new array with only unique values. Whenever I see a number that’s not already inside, I push it. The output is [1, 2, 3, 4].”

## Problem 6: Sum of All Numbers in an Array

    🗣 “Next is finding the sum of all numbers in an array. For example, [1, 2, 3, 4] should give us 10.
    My logic: I start with sum = 0, loop through the array, and keep adding each number to sum. At the end, I return the sum. Testing with [1, 2, 3, 4], the result is 10.”

## Problem 7: Find Even Numbers in an Array

    🗣 “The seventh problem is finding all even numbers in an array.
    My logic: I loop through the array and check if each number is divisible by 2. If yes, I push it into a new array. For [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the output is [2, 4, 6].”

## Problem 8: Capitalize First Letter of Each Word

    🗣 “Now let’s capitalize the first letter of each word in a sentence.
    My logic: I split the sentence into words, then for each word, I capitalize the first letter and add the rest of the word unchanged. Finally, I join them back into a sentence. For input ‘hello world’, the output is ‘Hello World’.”

## Problem 9: Find the Factorial of a Number

    🗣 “The ninth problem is factorial. Factorial of a number means multiplying all numbers from 1 to that number. For example, 5 factorial is 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.
    My logic: I start with result = 1, then multiply result by each number up to n. Testing with input 5, the output is 120.”

## Problem 10: PingPong Challenge

    🗣 *“Finally, we have the PingPong challenge. We need to print numbers from 1 to 20, but:

    For multiples of 3, print ‘Ping’.

    For multiples of 5, print ‘Pong’.

    For multiples of both, print ‘PingPong’.
    Otherwise, print the number itself.
    So the output looks like: 1, 2, Ping, 4, Pong, Ping, … and so on.
    My logic: I loop from 1 to 20, and use if-else conditions to check divisibility.”*
